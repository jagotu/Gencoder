There are five main parts to this application:
* main.cpp (which contains the basic application logic)
* gui.cpp (which does gui and is absolutely ugly
  because ncurses has an abysmal C API)
* Document (document.h & document.cpp)
* Transforms (core defined in transform.h, individual
  transformations defined in transforms folder)
* UTF-8 (the public domain utf8.h & utf8 folder
  and my own utf8_charclass.h)
