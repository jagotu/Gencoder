You need to have libncursesw installed.

Just `make` should be enough on most computers.
It definitely is in MFF's lab.

The make process creates a "gencoder" binary in
the root directory.

It turns out there can be two modes you can
compile ncurses in: one of them requires libtinfow,
one of them doesn't. If the app doesn't compile on your
computer, try removing "-ltinfow" from LDLIBS in the
Makefile.
